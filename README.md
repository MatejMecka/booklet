This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "Get Started" at https://bookdown.org/home/about/ for how to compile this example.


Todo:

- add links to all functions  
- add links for all packages  
- bibliography  
- namespace all functions for illustrative purposes of defensive coding  
- include a glossary in the intro so we can explain things like `::`  
- Tajp0s  
- Cyrillic text no rendered to pdf
